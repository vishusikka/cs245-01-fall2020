I worked solo on this assignment.

Description on how to run the program:
User needs to enter the numbers in each rows separately. Numbers must be entered with no space.  Zero represents empty cells.
Example of one row: 910780006
Once the board is entered, the program will calculate the solution and output the board on the terminal.
If there is no solution for the board that user entered, then the program prints an error message.
