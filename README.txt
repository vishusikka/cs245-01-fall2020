In this program, I created a LinkedList and we check if there is a cycle using the findCycle() method.
The findCycle() will first detect if there is any cycle in the LinkedList. If there is one, then it will find the starting index.
The runtime analysis for this method is O(n+k*n), and the space complexity is O(n).
